##### HOW RELIABLE IS MTN MOBILE MONEY?

> *Yes MTN Mobile Money is very reliable. Though, because their agents are everywhere, you may have a tendency of withdrawing and spending money often.*
>
> *If it's for saving, I'd prefer using a bank account instead of Mobile Money because with Mobile Money, I have that desire of withdrawing and spending, but the some sort of fear of withdrawing the money when it's on my bank account.*

##### HOW DO YOU KEEP TRACK OF ALL YOUR EXPENSES THROUGHOUT THE MONTH?

> *I use Excel. There's an Excel spreadsheet called "Personal Data sheet". I mostly use it monthly to track my expenses and incomes, because it shows a place for expenses and revenues.*

- Contact, photos, and videos are always backed up on Google Drive.
- Contacts and media backup and storage are very important to him.
- Feels comfortable to give out his phone number to an app he just downloaded.
- Rarely uses a computer to backup information from phone.
- Would never let a random stranger take his photo on the street.

##### ARE YOU COMFORTABLE GIVING YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO AN APP THAT YOU JUST DOWNLOADED?
