### Conveniences

```
- Also using EazzyPay to transfer money to accounts in different banks
- When borrowing money to friends and family or from them, money is expected to be paid back in 30 days

### Frustrations

- Irritated by Mobile Money fees
- Having cash in hand is not safe, there is a risk of losing it
- Connection problems when it comes to transferring money with the bank
- Having a lot of money on Mobile Money account increases desire for spending and withdrawing

### Money Management

- Spending's are planed
- Prefers to save money in a bank account to avoid overspending
- After receiving a salary, spending's are calculated and only needed amount is being transferred to MTN Mobile Money
> First, after being paid my salary, I do schedule for the expenses I have to make. So I estimate the amount of money I need for the coming month. Then I transfer the whole amount to the mobile money.
- Money that is not meant for spending is kept in a bank account
- Uses EazzyPay to keep track of expenses on Equity Bank Account
- Uses Excel Sheets to keep track of income & spent money in all accounts

### Behaviors

- When an app asks for a sign up, usually uses email address
- Doesn't think that singing up with a phone number is more personal
> IF AN APP ASKS YOU FOR A PHONE NUMBER DO YOU HESITATE?
>
> - No, cause the phone number it's not something more personal. Mm, I mean I prefer email.
- Plans on getting an SD card
- Would provide phone PIN to family and friends 
- Wouldn't give the PIN to the person fixing the phone, but would put it in for them

### Conveniences

- Email is more convenient for singing up for an account
- When a phone runs out of space usually would delete photos and WhatsApp videos

### Frustrations

- Worried that a person fixing the phone might misuse the PIN
- Lost photos, contacts, videos and documents, because of lack of knowledge about backups

> - I lost a phone two years back and at that time, I didn't know that you can, you can save your contacts, photos, videos. But now I save my contacts on Google account. So if I lost a phone, I can find it on my email.
