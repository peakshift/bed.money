## STORE OF VALUE & PAYMENTS

### Behaviours

- Stores the majority of revenues on MTN Mobile Money which also serves as a payment account
- Currently saving to start a side business to generate additional revenues
- Saves regularly
- Preferred cash before COVID-19 but now hardly receives it
- Sends money to family in the countryside via MTN Mobile Money
> Before COVID people paid in cash, now as the government encourages cashless, 99% of my clients are using Mobile Money.

> Even I have gone cashless, if you ask me for Rwf 1000, I won't have it because people pay me using Mobile Money.

- Gets paid by clients: 
1. Mobile Money
2. Bank Account
3. Cash

#### Do you use any other cashless payment methods? If someone want to pay with a card, can they do that? 

> No, they can't. What they do is that they'll withdraw their money using mobile banking. Because it's linked with their mobile money, then can just transfer it to their mobile money and then they can pay me with it.

### Conveniences

- MTN - Mobile Money pros: 
   - Most people use MTN - Mobile Money
   - Easy access
   - Quick Transactions
   - Has a proof that money was actually sent
   - Has agents for cashing out everywhere
   - Reliability

> The problems is we are used to MTN services. Our families, friends, bosses, clients, they all use MTN. It's hard to call someone and for someone to call you back when they are in another network.

- Airtel pros: 
   - Good service for not charging for transactions
   - Good advertisment
   - Fast Internet

> So, if you look at the cost-effectiveness, and internet speed, Airtel is the best [in Rwanda].

> The reason why we're sticking to MTN is that our people, our friends are on MTN. So, it's hard to tell someone: "Do you have Airtel? I want to send you some money." But as people buy Airtel for internet, they'll end up using it for other services too, like SMS and calling even mobile money. 

BED.MONEY NOTES
<small> This participant has confirmed something we found interesting in other user personas and that is that they have never experienced to send money to someone who is using a different provider, like Airtel or Tigo.</small>

### Frustrations

- Would like to be able to purchase things on instalments, but is not able to access due to unstable earnings.
- High interest rates when it comes to borrowing money from friends.
- Not knowing if you will be in a situation to pay someone back. 
> Nobody knows what future holds. What if you invest that money and you don't get it back? I would invest in some business, but I am afraid of partnership, most people don't take it very personaly, maybe because they have their main jobs, but it's different when it comes to sharing a profit.
- Companies and individuals that used services are not working due to COVID-19, so there is not a lot of work.

### Money Management 

- Uses a spreadsheet to keep track of expenses.

## Diary Study

### Starting Balances
- MTN - MoMo : 21,865.00 RWF
