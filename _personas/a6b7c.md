## STORE OF VALUE & PAYMENTS

### Behaviors

- Cash is least preferred because there is a tendency to misuse it, but still spendings are planned in advance and daily payments are done with cash. When there is no cash "gets lazy" and won't be bothered with transfering money from bank account to Mobile Money and takes into consideration fees that will be charged for those transactions.
- Even when it comes to bigger transactions prefers to find the product and withdraw money after that instead of using Mobile Money in order to avoid being charged. Except when it comes to online shopping which is done with a card. Does online shopping on:

   - Aliexpress
   - Ebay
   - Amazon
   - Food delivery from local online shops

- When it comes to sending money to friends and family it is done through the bank account, mobile money or cash.
- Sends mobile money to an older relative via Tigo money. 
- When taking loans from other people, payback depends on the [loose] agreement with the individual.
- Receives primary income as a cheque.

{% endmermaid %}

- Same bank transfers are done through Bank of Kigali account, because large amount of money is usually there. 
- Bank of Kigali is the main account and holds the largest amount of money
- Most preferred bank is Equity because it's more flexible, has more agents and it has easy access.
- Another advantage of banking with Equity is no need for an app, money can be transferred to Mobile Money through EazzyPay. 

##### TRANSFERING MONEY FROM EQUITY BANK TO MOBILE MONEY

{% mermaid %}

{% endmermaid %}

- When it comes to transferring money from Equity Bank to Mobile Money everything is being done through USSD. In order to do that phone number needs to be connected to the bank account.

> You need to download BK app and from that app you send it to Mobile Money, if you don't have an app you can only transfer it to another Bank Account in this case Equity Bank and from there you can put it on Mobile Money.[^bank_of_kigali_ux_1]

### Conveniences

- Cash
  - No fees
- Equity Bank
  - Easy access
  - No need for downloading an app
  - More agents available
  - More flexible

### Frustrations

- Fees for making transactions over Mobile Money seems to be a problem. People using MTN might not be willing to switch to another provider because that will cause problems with communication with other people.

### Money Management

- Checking balance as a way of keeping track of all accounts
- Monitoring expenses is not an option, because of the tendency to overspend and feeling bad because of it
  - Is planning your spending's in advance a money management skill if you have a tendency to misuse it? 

## Diary Study

### Starting Balances
- 500 RWF on Mobile Money (airtime)
- 10.000 cash (budgeted for personal stuff next week)

### Transactions

BED.MONEY Notes
- Never lost a phone before, because it's always around. Has previously lost contacts and photos but when that happened the phone was been changed or was damaged. 
> If I have to change a phone or my phone dies and I have to recover my contacts and it's so hard, before I didn't know how to save it on my email, but now I can recover it if I change phones.

- Manages multiple email address.
- When the phone's Out of Storage Warning comes up another email account is created to get free 15gb cloud storage. 

### Conveniences

- Android phones
  - It has certain apps that iPhone doesn't
- Signing up with a phone number, because apps just send an SMS, so it's done itself automatically 
> I actually like signing up with my phone, because if I forget my password I will just have to put in my phone number and maybe they will fix that, I don't know... I am least paranoid and least interesting, so I am not worried about people hacking me. 

### Frustrations

- Loses interest when an app requires a sign up, unless it's social media
> If it's a workout app, why do I need to sign up? I am not going to call anybody, I am not going to chat, I just want to see your programs.

> Signing up with an email is frustrating because you have to go back to the email and find the link they sent you.


[^bank_of_kigali_ux_1]: When it comes to transferring money from Bank of Kigali to Mobile Money it seems like a long and tedious process for some people.
