title: Hey, we are talking about money here!
participant: 1
description: Works full-time but also has a side hustle. Didn't experience any changes due to COVID-19 when it comes to working hours. Getting paid from the company on a bank account. Doesn't like waiting for change when paying with cash at the market or when taking a motor bike - especially after some bad experience with not getting the correct change. Considers Mobile Money as safer but not necessarily quicker. Most preferred way to get paid is cash. Would prefer to create a new Gmail account to get an additional 15GB of space, instead of getting a paid Google Drive subscription.

### Conveniences

- Prefers using cash, and says having cash on hand does not increase spending behavior

> It's all of the same to me. If I have money on my mobile money, credit card or bank cards. I use them as much as I use cash. If I want to buy something online. I can use a card or if I want to order something from Vuba Vuba or in other places they can pay by cash or mobile money or bank. So the same.

> WHY IS CASH THE BEST PAYMENT METHOD? 
> - Hey, we are talking about money here. If there is a way to send and receive money without being charged any fees, I would always choose that.
>
- Paying for small transactions with cash 

> It's more convenient to pay with cash for small transactions, sometimes you have to go out and maybe you want to buy something from a street salesman like fruits and vegetables. In those cases you have to use cash because they don't understand how Mobile Money works.

- In some situations paying with Mobile Money is easier

> With Mobile Money you send only what you need to send. Mobile Money is easier definitely before you finish the ride you can ask the driver for his phone number and by the time you get to your destination you can just walk away. You don't have to be stuck and wait for change.

### Frustrations

- Dislikes waiting for market vendors or motor drivers to get change and doesn't trust handing over cash if they don't have change
- Won't borrow from banks because getting in debt to them is scary
- Fear of someone running away with your money while waiting for change
- Fees when it comes to transferring funds via Mobile Money, Mobile banking has the same procedure and causes the same frustrations 

### Money Management

- Using notes on the phone to keep track of expenses and who owes money

## Privacy, Security & Backups

### Behaviors

- Is conscious about pin security
- Backup and Storage is not on top of mind
- Would put the pin for a person fixing the phone
- Contacts and photos were backed up on Google Drive

> WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN AN APPLICATION YOU HAVE JUST DOWNLOADED ASKS YOU FOR YOUR PHONE NUMBER?
>
> - There are these apps that you know, for sure that they need it, you always understand the logic behind it. Otherwise I don't provide it, but if it's a social media app like Twitter or Instagram, I know for a fact they will need it to generate my contacts and make me communicate with people. That's why they need my contact information. If it is a dictionary, come on. Why do you need my names and things to give me a dictionary?

### Conveniences

- When storage runs out of space, data would be transferred to other accounts or Dropbox
- Would be willing to create a new Gmail account in order to avoid having to pay for more storage for Google Drive
- Sometimes uses a computer to backup information from Google Drive
- For writing reviews on Google Maps received 500 GB 

> WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOUR GOOGLE CLOUD RUNS OUT OF SPACE?
>
> - That's hasn't reached there yet. I can figure out something when that happens. I would go back and delete some things or transfer some of my things to some of the other accounts. You know, there are so many other ways you can, can have them online. Someone can even have 2 Gmail accounts or use Dropbox.

### Frustrations

- Doesn't understand why certain apps that are not social media ask for a phone number
